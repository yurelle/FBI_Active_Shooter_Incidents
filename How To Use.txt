This project consists of 2 views into the same dataset. The finalized, prebuilt version of both of these can be found in the "Pre-Built Datasets" folder.
	1) Excel Spreadsheet:
		Available as either a Microsoft Excel file or CSV
	2) Relational Database (Implemented via MySQL):
		Available as either a pre-populated Schema build script, or
		incremental build scripts, starting with the Schema structure,
		then populating it with the raw values from the spreadsheet,
		and then performing an ETL to populate the advanced relational
		tables. This is available in case you want to modify the data,
		or need to perform dialect changes to work with a different
		brand of database.
		
		The pre-populated script can be found here:
		"Pre-Built Datasets/FinalDB___fbi_active_shooters_2000_2018.sql"
		
		The incremental build scripts can be found here. Simply run them
		in order, and you will end up with a database identical to the one
		contained in the pre-populated build script.
