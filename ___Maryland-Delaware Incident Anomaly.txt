The active shooter incident titled:
"Advanced Granite Solutions and 28th Street Auto Sales and Service"
in the FBI report, consists of 2 incidents crossing state lines. The first incident occurred in Maryland; the shooter then drove 52 miles, across state lines, into Delaware, where he met with a group of 2 people in a garage, and shot one of them. 

In the FBI report, both of these incidents are considered the same incident. In the spreadsheet, this is handled by having the state column filled in as "Maryland & Delaware". However, the database tables enforce standardized state names. So, there are 2 state records for the same incident record.

Be careful when using this data that you do not count this incident twice. If you do, your totals will not match the FBI's official numbers.
